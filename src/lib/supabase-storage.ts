 * every uploaded file gets a permanent URL.
 *
 * A permanent URL matters beyond hosting: Instagram/Facebook publish by
 * *fetching* the media URL from Meta's servers, so the URL has to stay
 * reachable. The old Cloudflare-tunnel URLs changed on every restart, which is
 * why publish-service.ts still rebases legacy `/uploads/*` links.
